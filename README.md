# Next.js 15 Runtime Error: Unexpected error during page rendering

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js 15 that occurs when a page file is missing or contains a syntax error.  The error message is not always clear, making debugging difficult.

## The Bug

The `pages/index.js` file is either missing or contains a syntax error that causes the rendering process to fail.  This results in a runtime error during the application's build or execution.

## The Solution

Ensure that the `pages/index.js` (or the relevant page file) exists and contains valid JavaScript code.  Thoroughly check for syntax errors, typos, and any other issues that might cause a runtime failure.   If you're using external libraries, make sure they are properly installed and configured.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Attempt to start the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the error message in your terminal.
